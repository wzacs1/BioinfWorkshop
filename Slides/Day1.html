# Part 1: Intro to Unix
### 2020-05-12
### Instructor: Zac Stephens

---

# Requirements:
- An internet connection with a browser.
- A CHPC account.
- (optional) These slides as github markdown:
https://github.com/wzacs1/BioinfWorkshop (click on link for Part 1)
---

# Conventions and Setup
- Code that to be entered will be set aside in a "code chunk" like this, with a command prompt `$` at the beginning (you don't need to enter this):
```bash
$ cd $HOME
$ ls
```

--
- You do not enter the `$`.  This is the command line prompt.

--
- Short chunks in-line, or within the written text like `this`. Not usually meant to be entered but is just to highlight a command or output.

---
# Conventions and Setup 2
- When intended to enter your own values: `<Your_User_ID_Here>`

--
- Make directories and filenames the same as listed here

--
- Consider everything to be case-sensitive

---
# Unix and Linux
- UNIX is a family of operating systems with a common lineage and many shared features.

--
- Linux and Mac OSX are the Unix operating systems you have most likely encountered and have diverged longer ago than most.

--
- Other Linux Distributions:
	- CentOS, RedHat and Debian or Ubuntu.

--
- Most of what you learn on one Unix system can be directly applied to another.
	- Interoperability is thanks in part to the original Unix philosophy of "do one thing, and do it well".
- Linux commands generally input through the **command line interface (CLI)**.

---

# The Command Line Interface
- Contrast to GUI.
	- Interpreted through a **shell**,
	 	- Itself displayed in applications on your computer usually called something like **terminal**.

--
- On your local Mac (desktop, laptop), the Application called "Terminal" will open a new shell.

--
- We will use a terminal-like web-based interface on CHPC throughout this course.
	- In the future, if you want to work on your local computer you can generally use Terminal, and all or most of what you learn here will apply directly because Mac-Terminal's default shell (bash) is the same as we will use on Linux.

--
- Why learn the CLI? Won't there be a GUI developed for that if it's really useful?

---

# Shells
- The shell is the actual command-line interpreter within the terminal that you use.

	- Interprets what you write.

--

	- There are several shell languages: bash, zsh, tcsh and fish.
	- We will use `bash` throughout the course.

---

# Open your first shell
- In your browser, navigate to CHPC OnDemand, login with UNID and credentials.

[https://ondemand.chpc.utah.edu/](https://ondemand.chpc.utah.edu/)
Login with your usual UNID credentials.


--
- Advantages:
	- Accessible anywhere with internet connection

--
	- Simple interface (opposed to virtual desktops)

--
	- Files and basic editing in the same place as well

--
	- Templates, monitoring of jobs

--
	- Start graphical R Studio interface in same place

---

# Explore the OnDemand interface

1. Open your home space to view files.
	- Note text string at top: `/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/<Your_UNID>`

--
2. Access the Lonepeak cluster in a new shell.
```bash
$ srun -A MIB2020 -p lonepeak --reservation MIB2020 -n 2 --time 2:00:00 --pty /bin/bash -l
```

--
3. Determine which directory you are in. Enter the "print working directory" command as shown below. Tells you where you are currently.
```bash
$ pwd
```

---

# A brief CHPC overview

- The University of Utah Center for High-Performance Computing (CHPC) is an outstanding resource available to all researchers at the U.

--
- Consists of multiple computing **clusters** that each contain many **nodes**, which themselves are each powerful computers.

---

# A brief CHPC overview

- It *conceptually* looks *a bit* like this:

---

# A brief CHPC overview

- Head node (or login node) **not to be used for major computing** tasks!

# Mounting your CHPC home space on your computer

- OnDemand interface provides a way to download and upload files directly, so really is all you need.
- However, it can be handy to mount your CHPC space directly on your computer and have it show up as another folder, allowing easy drag and drop of files.
- Must be connnected to the University of Utah network for this to work.
- Procedure is different depending on your OS, so I will not go through it (path-IT can help - networking can be confusing especially on Windows!)
- CHPC provides information on how to do this here, under the "Direct Mounts of CHPC file systems" section:
[https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/data_services.php](https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/data_services.php)

---

# Root and Directory Structure
- "**Root**": the absolute highest/top/base level of a file system
	- Referred to by the very first forward slash `/`.

--
	- You will not have access here on CHPC *or your own computer normally*.
		- Must be kept isolated.

--
		- Everything else starts here though.

--
- Directory Structur (Note: "folder" == directory):

--
- On Mac, the typical directory structure looks something like this (with many directories removed):
![Mac directory structure](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1P0NQ5OXx4I50SuiTgVIBQCDXr7kWyCyg)

--
- On CHPC, the directory structure more complicated,
 	- Your home directory is instead in `/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/<User_ID>`.

--
- Because home is so common to reference, it gets it's own special symbol: `~`

---
# A Few Words on File(Directory) Naming Conventions

--

## Naming:

- Spaces are used to identify discrete commands, options, identifiers, etc. in all programming languages to some degree (or entirely).

--
	- Spaces in names are major problem, or at least frequent annoyance.
		- Require a special "escape" character written.

--
- Two major solutions exist (or some combination of the two):

--
	- "**Camel case**": Capitalize the first letter of everyword.
		- For example: MyFileName.txt

--
	- **Underscores** ( _ ):
		- For example: My_File_Name.txt

--
 - Note that the dash "-" is frequently used as well.
 	- Generally OK
	- I recommned staying away from it's use where possible.
		- Often interepreted as a range (eg.  from one to three is `1-3`)

---

#  File extensions/suffixes

- The file extension (for example, ".txt" or ".docx") **DOES NOT** define the content or format of a file.
	- The *file extension is simply part of the name*. Misnomer.

--

- 3 important points here though:
	1. The content of the file does not change if the extension is changed.

--

	2. The "extension", if present, must be included when referring to a file.

--

	3. Only the extension after the last `.` matters for most OS recognition.
		- No problem with multiple **`.`**'s. For example, `sequences.fasta.gz`

---

#  File extensions/suffixes

- Generally, good idea to include file extensions so you or others know what the format or content of the file is.
- Only works if you follow conventions. Examples:
	- `.txt`: A general, plain text file
	- `.tsv`: A tab-separated value file. Quite frequently, these are also just listed as .txt
	- `.csv`: comma-separated value file.
	- `.md`: A markdown file
	- `.py`: a Python script

---

# First Linux Commands: Moving around and Creating Your Environment

- In your shell in your terminal window make sure you are in home directory still and make a directory:
	- `mkdir`: "**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory"

--

```bash
$ mkdir BioinfWorkshop2020
```

--

- Use the `ls` command to list the directory contents of your home directory in 2 different ways.

```bash
$ ls /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/<Your_User_ID>/
$ ls ~/
```

---

# First Linux Commands: Moving around and Creating Your Environment

- Move into your new course directory using the change directory command:
	- `cd`: **c**hange **d**irectory

```bash
$ cd BioinfWorkshop2020
```

--

- Use `pwd` to show where you are and verify you have changed directories:
```bash
$ pwd
```

--

- Make a directory for this part of the course within this directory:
```bash
$ mkdir Part1_Linux
```

---

# Tab autocompletion, history and a couple keyboard shortcuts aside:

- Lots of typing. Lots of ways to **save keystrokes** and **reduce errors**!

--

- Press Tab key ONCE when start typing.
	- Autocompletes IF only 1 possible match.

--

- Press Tab key TWICE quickly after you start typing.
	- Your shell lists the possible matches and maintain what you have already typed.

--

- Try this out.
	- First, `cd` to your new `Part1_Linux` directory by starting to type it then tab autocomplete.

```bash
$ cd Par
```
--

- Use `pwd` to make sure you are in the `Part1_Linux` directory.
```bash
$ pwd
```

---

# Tab-autocomplete continued and copying files

- `cp`: **c**o**p**y. Format: `cp <File_To_Be_Copied> <Where_to_copy_the_file>`
- Copy a test file from my group's space to your directory
```bash
$ cp /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/round-group2/BioinfWorkshop2020/Part1_Linux/table.txt \
~/BioinfWorkshop2020/Part1_Linux/
```

--

- The command above is the same as this command (you don't need to enter this, but it won't hurt):
```bash
$ cp /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/round-group2/BioinfWorkshop2020/Part1_Linux/table.txt \
~/BioinfWorkshop2020/Part1_Linux/table.txt
```
- If given a directory only, `cp` will copy the file to that directory maintaining the filename. If pointing to a file name, `cp` can be used to copy and rename the file at the same time.

---

# Command Line History

- Up and down arrows can be used to scroll through the histroy of your commands.
	- Saving A LOT of typing.

--

- Use the up arrow to get your previous command and change the read1.fastq to read2.fastq. Changing table.txt to read1.fastq or read2.fastq:

```bash
$ cp /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/round-group2/BioinfWorkshop2020/Part1_Linux/read1.fastq ./
$ cp /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/round-group2/BioinfWorkshop2020/Part1_Linux/read2.fastq ./
```

#### A couple useful keyboard shortcuts
It can be useful to move to the end or the beginning of a very long command.
- Ctrl+A: Moves cursor to the beginning of command line
- Ctrl+E: Moves cursor to the end command line.

---

# Directory references and paths

--

- "Path": The route or path one takes to a given file or directory. It can be absolute or relative.

--

- "Absolute Path": When the path to a file is listed beginning with root.
 	- Thus tends to contain the full text for each directory leading to the file or directory of interest.
	- Example: Instead of `~`, we would have `/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/<UNID>/` as the absolute path to your home directory.
	- Always safer to use absolute paths, but the lengths can become cumbersome, thus...

--

- "Relative Paths": The path to a file *relative* to the directory you are in or some other shortcut/link (such as `~`).
	- `./`: The current directory you are in
	- `../`: The directory up one level from what you are in.
	- `~`: Your home directory.

--

- Use `ls` with iterations of `../` to list the contents of directories further and further up in your directory structure:

```bash
$ ls ../
$ ls ../../
```
Try combining with `~` and names of directory to explore the behavior more.

---

# More on file listing with `ls` and options to commands

- `ls` is most common command you will type.

--
- Options are given directly after the command, separated by a space, and proceeded by a dash `-`.
	- Convention, not a rule.
	- `--` for "long listing" of options. Return to later.

--

- `ls` options:
	- `-l`: This is the long listing format which gives file permissions and sizes, and lists one file per line.
	- `-h`: Human-readable format for file sizes.
	- `-t`: sort them by timestamp
	- `-a`: Show all files (including those hidden: files that start with a `.`)

---

# `ls` options

- `ls` options:
	- `-l`: This is the long listing format which gives file permissions and sizes, and lists one file per line.
	- `-h`: Human-readable format for file sizes.
	- `-t`: sort them by timestamp
	- `-a`: Show all files (including those hidden: files that start with a `.`)

- Add these options to your file listings. From the `Part1_Linux` directory

```bash
$ ls -l
$ ls -l -h
$ ls -lh
```

--

- Notice how `ls -l -h` and `ls -lh` produce the same output.
	- Only works for "flags", turning an option on or off.

--

```bash
$ ls -l -a ~/
```

---

# Manual pages for commands

- Manual pages are built in and available for nearly all commands.
	- They are accessible by using the `man` command.
- `man`: Format `man <command>`

--

Open the manual page for the `ls` command to see all the options.
```bash
$ man ls
```

--

- Scroll through it with
	-`spacebar` to move a full page down
	- `d` and `u` keys to move 1/2 page down and up.
	- Use `q` to exit the manual page.
	- Use `/` to bring up a text input and search within the manual page.

---

# The `chmod` command for file permissions.

- What are all those `-`'s and `r`'s when you do the long file listings?

--

	- The type of listing, as well as the file permissions for three different user groups.

--
class: left, middle

- There are 10 spaces. In order from left to right:
	- Position 1: What type of listing is it. `-` for a regular file, `d` for directory, `l` for links
	- Position 2-10: File permission for different groups
- Each position indicate read (`r`), write (`w`) or execute (`x`) permissions.
	- If it's a directory, `x` indicates whether it is searchable or not.

---
class: left, middle

# The `chmod` command for file permissions.

- There are 10 spaces. In order from left to right:
	- Position 1: What type of listing is it. `-` for a regular file, `d` for directory, `l` for links
	- Position 2,3,4: File permission for the user `u`
	- Position 5,6,7: File permission for the group `g`
	- Position 8,9,10: File permission for others `o` or all `a`

- To summarize with image example:

![File Permisssions](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Nyi8364J2jLBm-27Z3bHSppEOi-zGnbV)

---

# The `chmod` command for file permissions.

- `chmod` command can be used to change file permissions of a file or directory.
	- Options do not take a dash.**UNIQUE**

--

- Options use a formula instead:
	- Single letter indicates user, group or other or all
	- Then, `+` or `-` to indicate add or remove
	- Then, permissions (one, two or three) to add or remove
- Examples:
	- `chmod u+w <FILENAME>`: Add the write permission (`w`) for the user.
	- `chmod a+wrx <FILENAME>`:  Add the write(`w`), read (`r`) and execute (`x`) permissions for all `a`.
	- `chmod g-w <FILENAME>`: Remove the write (`w`) permissions from the group (`g`).

---

# With Your Own Data
Little to do for the intro parts. But you can still setup some things and practice moving around
- Create a project directory.
- Upload metadata files or sequence files to your project directory.
- Change the file permissions. Try removing read permissions from a file and then try to copy it.
- How can you change permissions for a directory?
- Explore options on the manual page for `mkdir` and `pwd`.
