# Intro to Bioinformatics Tools Workshop
> Initial: Summer Semester 2020 \
> Author: W. Zac Stephens

This workshop is geared towards learning the basics of common bioinformatic tools. The objective is not necessarily to teach specific analyses, but to get biologists with no previous coding experience some exposure and working understanding of basic command-line skills so that they can continue learning by doing with their own datasets, and better take advantage of the many online tutorials that go through specific types of analyses.

We use the OnDemand interface at the University of Utah's Center for High-Performance Computing throughout because it provides a common environemnt for all users, and also because we will discuss it's usage for high-throughput sequencing experiments.

Here I provide detailed workthroughs from each workshop day as .html files. Each served as the basis for the slides from each day and have more written explanation so that they can hopefully be worked through alone. I will likely update them at the end of each day, depending on how far we get.
